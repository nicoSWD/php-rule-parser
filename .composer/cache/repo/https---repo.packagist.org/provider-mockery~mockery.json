is a simple yet flexible PHP mock object framework for use in unit testing with PHPUnit, PHPSpec or any other testing framework. Its core goal is to offer a test double framework with a succint API capable of clearly defining all possible object operations and interactions using a human readable Domain Specific Language (DSL). Designed as a drop in alternative to PHPUnit's phpunit-mock-objects library, Mockery is easy to integrate with PHPUnit and can operate alongside phpunit-mock-objects without the World ending.","version":"0.9.3","version_normalized":"0.9.3.0","source":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","reference":"686f85fa5b3b079cc0157d7cd3e9adb97f0b41e1"},"dist":{"type":"zip","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/686f85fa5b3b079cc0157d7cd3e9adb97f0b41e1","reference":"686f85fa5b3b079cc0157d7cd3e9adb97f0b41e1","shasum":""},"time":"2014-12-22T10:06:19+00:00","require":{"php":">=5.3.2","lib-pcre":">=7.0"},"require-dev":{"phpunit/phpunit":"~4.0","hamcrest/hamcrest-php":"~1.1","satooshi/php-coveralls":"~0.7@dev"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/0.9.3"}},{"version":"0.9.2","version_normalized":"0.9.2.0","source":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","reference":"95a4855380dc70176c51807c678fb3bd6198529a"},"dist":{"type":"zip","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/95a4855380dc70176c51807c678fb3bd6198529a","reference":"95a4855380dc70176c51807c678fb3bd6198529a","shasum":""},"time":"2014-09-03T10:11:10+00:00","support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/0.9.2"}},{"version":"0.9.1","version_normalized":"0.9.1.0","source":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","reference":"17f63ee40ed14a8afb7ba1f0ae15cc4491d719d1"},"dist":{"type":"zip","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/17f63ee40ed14a8afb7ba1f0ae15cc4491d719d1","reference":"17f63ee40ed14a8afb7ba1f0ae15cc4491d719d1","shasum":""},"time":"2014-05-02T12:16:45+00:00","support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/0.9.1"}},{"version":"0.9.0","version_normalized":"0.9.0.0","source":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","reference":"0fd49fd3f6c984409802004b1dd7b55d0f35ce4a"},"dist":{"type":"zip","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/0fd49fd3f6c984409802004b1dd7b55d0f35ce4a","reference":"0fd49fd3f6c984409802004b1dd7b55d0f35ce4a","shasum":""},"time":"2014-02-05T21:30:08+00:00","require-dev":{"hamcrest/hamcrest-php":"~1.1","satooshi/php-coveralls":"dev-master"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/0.9.0"}},{"version":"0.8.0","version_normalized":"0.8.0.0","authors":[{"name":"Pádraic Brady","email":"padraic.brady@gmail.com","homepage":"http://blog.astrumfutura.com"}],"source":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","reference":"35f0e18022f5538df9df8920a3d96c1761d63220"},"dist":{"type":"zip","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/35f0e18022f5538df9df8920a3d96c1761d63220","reference":"35f0e18022f5538df9df8920a3d96c1761d63220","shasum":""},"time":"2013-04-01T12:13:17+00:00","require":{"php":">=5.3.2"},"require-dev":{"hamcrest/hamcrest":"1.1.0"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/0.8.0"},"extra":"__unset"},{"version":"0.7.2","version_normalized":"0.7.2.0","license":["New BSD"],"source":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","reference":"10ef0f8a63392f244e5b19de261b6a08eb8e4109"},"dist":{"type":"zip","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/10ef0f8a63392f244e5b19de261b6a08eb8e4109","reference":"10ef0f8a63392f244e5b19de261b6a08eb8e4109","shasum":""},"time":"2012-01-24T20:22:39+00:00","suggest":{"Hamcrest":"1.0.0"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/0.7.2"},"require-dev":"__unset"}]},"last-modified":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 15:34:20 GMT"}
